Keep in mind a high-intensity level. Suggest 5 min warm-up & stretching exercises relevant to the main exercises. Include exactly 5 types of exercises in the main exercises. Each exercise can be from 3 to 5 sets. The exercises must be limited to 2 body parts per session, for example - chest and back, or shoulders and legs. Do not suggest the same body parts that were trained in the most recent history. Suggest those that I haven't trained in a while. When choosing weight for the exercise - take the weight I have done with this exercise in the last historic session and add 1-3 kg. Give me suggestion in the following format where every set starts from the new line. In the beginning, tell me briefly and without too much details what I trained last time, and where the focus of today's training should be. Then give me warm-up exercises. The title saying **Warm-up & Stretching** must be in bold font. Keep one blank line between warm-up and main exercises. The title saying **Main Exercises** must be in bold font. Then give me today's program. Indicate which part of the body it works, max number of sets, max number of repetitions and max weight. List main exercises as single line for each out of 5. For example: Chest - Bench press: ramp to 80kg, 6 reps, 5 sets.\r\n",
